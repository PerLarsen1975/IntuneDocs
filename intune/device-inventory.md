# See device details in Intune

[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]

The **Devices** feature provides additional details into the devices you manage, including their hardware and the apps installed.

This article shows you how to view all your devices, and their properties in the Azure portal.

## View the device details

1. Sign in to [Intune](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2090973).
3. Select **Devices** > **All devices** > select one of your listed devices to open its details:

   - **Overview** shows the device name, and lists some key properties of the device, including whether it's a bring-your-own-device (BYOD) device, when it checked in, and more. You can perform the following actions on the device:
      - [Retire](devices-wipe.md#retire)
	    - [Wipe](devices-wipe.md#wipe)
	    - [Remote lock](device-remote-lock.md)
	    - [Synchronize device](device-sync.md)
	    - [Reset passcode](device-passcode-reset.md)
	    - [Restart](device-restart.md) (Windows only)
	    - [Fresh Start](device-fresh-start.md) (Windows only)
     - Start a remote assistance session
   - Use **Properties** to assign a [device category you create](device-group-mapping.md), and change ownership of the device to a personal device, or a corporate device.
   - **Hardware** includes many details about the device, including the device ID, the operating system and version, storage space, the model and manufacturer, Conditional Access settings, and more details.
   - **Discovered apps** lists all the apps that Intune found installed on the device, and the app versions. You can also **Export** the app list into a .csv file. This list is updated every 7 days.
   - **Device compliance** lists all assigned compliance policies, and if the device is compliant or not compliant.
   - **Device configuration** shows all device configuration policies assigned to the device, and if the policy succeeded or failed.

Intune collects an app list only on corporate-owned devices. Apps aren't checked on personal devices. For Windows 10 PCs, only modern apps are listed for corporate-owned devices. Intune doesn't collect information about Win32 apps on the device unless you're using the [Intune Management Extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/intune-management-extension). This only works on corporate owned devices.. Depending on the carrier used by the devices, not all apps might be collected. There is no aggregated view and can only viewed on a per-device basis currently.

|--------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|  
|Windows 10 (without the Configuration Manager client)|Only managed modern apps|All modern apps installed on the device|
